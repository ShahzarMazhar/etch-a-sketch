## About This Project
It is just like a pixelate drawing pad, has random color mode and single color mode. cool thing about the color is on changing the color it changes the whole theme i.e. logo color and button hover color etc. It response to hover or click as whatever the users selection, border can be removed and also add back. Grid size is also flexible it can be set to between 1x1 to 100x100 just by sliding the slider in the sidebar. It also had a reset button which clear the pad and also some other settings to default, and a clear button which just clear the pad.
